# AUTOMATED WASTE SEGREGATION ♻️

## 📄 Project Overview
This project presents an **Automated Waste Segregation System** designed to classify waste into **Wet, Dry, and Metallic** categories using sensors and microcontroller-based automation.

The system reduces **manual waste sorting**, supports **recycling**, and improves **environmental hygiene** through a smart, low-cost embedded solution.

## 📖 Project Abstract
The Automated Waste Segregation system detects and sorts waste using a combination of **IR sensors, Proximity (Metal) sensors, and Moisture sensors**. Based on the sensor data, the system automatically directs waste into the appropriate bin using **Servo and Stepper motors** controlled by an **Arduino UNO**.

This project aims to minimize human intervention in waste segregation and promote efficient recycling practices.
